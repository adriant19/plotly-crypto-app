# Plotly Crypto App


**Deployed on Heroku at**: [Heroku Crypto Price App](https://plotly-dash-adriant19.herokuapp.com/)

<br>

#### DESCRIPTION
----------------

This app was deployed on Heroku as a cloud hosting platform to showcase an interactive dashboard that was developed using Python.

The application scrapes the [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) website for crpyto coin prices with changes of prices in 3 different timeframes (last 1 hour, 24 hours, and 7 days).

The application was developed using plotly for data visualisation with dash components to enable users to make changes to the graph objects.

#### IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------

Some challenges that were faced when dealing with dash could serve as an opportunity to improve, namely:

- Variety of coins that were scraped, to be included as a multi-select filter to provide users with the ability to filter out specific coins to be viewed/compared.
